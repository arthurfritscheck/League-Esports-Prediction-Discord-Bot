# League-Esports-Prediction-Discord-Bot
A discord bot for the prediction of outcomes of professional League of Legends matches.

# Description
This bot is designed to host prediction competitions for League of Legends Esports matches within a discord server. The competition(s) you want to predict can be specified.
The data for the matches is fetched from the Leaguepedia API, which results in the bot sending out a match for upcoming match(es) that are coming up in the leagues/tournaments specified. Predictions are then transformed into the same format as the Leaguepedia database to facilitate comparison with the actual result after the match has happened.
